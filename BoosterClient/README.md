# Thread Priority Booster Client

`BoosterClient <ThreadId> <Priority_betn_1_to_31>`

Make sure you have the [Thread Priority Booster](../ThreadPriorityBooster) compiled in Debug build (this is to check logs in DbgView).
Then install and start the driver. Then run this client executable.

You can select a thread id from any process (use process explorer) and check the `dynamic priority` value of that thread.
