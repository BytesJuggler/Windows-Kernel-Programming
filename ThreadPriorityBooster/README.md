# Thread Priority Booster

First fully coded kernel mode driver.


- Install and Start driver
- Look in `WinObj` and make sure the symlink for Driver Device is present in `Global??` and actual Driver Device name is in `Driver` directory.


This Driver has a respective client executable to test: `BoosterClient`. Look at that project for further info.
